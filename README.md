# Introduction

This chrome extension allows you to configure and capture a tab periodically. The capture process is running in the background so you only need to configure the capture interval and click `start`. 
Just make sure to put the page you want to capture at the active state. To stop the process, click `stop`.

## Limitations & Future Plans

* There might be abuse of permissions, will refine in later versions.
* Currently the extension only captures visible parts of a tab. Will support a whole page capture in the future.
* May support capturing specified tabs in the future.
* Support specifying downloaded filenames and destination in the future.
